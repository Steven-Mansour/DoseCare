Hello :), this is the readme file for DoseCare.

To run the project:
1) Make sure you clone/download the code.
2) Create a database for the project. (Memorize the name)
3) Create a .env file at the root and include the line: DATABASE_URL = 'mysql://name:password@localhost/databaseName'
4) Open your code editor (VScode) and run npm install in the terminal.
5) You might need to install some modules: 'pip install python-dotenv'
6) Run createDB.py to create the tables in the database.
7) Run populateDB.py to populate the database.
8) Finally, type 'flask run' in the terminal to run the project.

If you encounter any error, you might be missing some modules.
